\f0\fs24 \cf0 # Stroke Prediction Dataset\
\
## Overview\
\
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), stroke is the 2nd leading cause of death globally, responsible for approximately 11% of total deaths. This dataset is designed for predicting the likelihood of a patient having a stroke based on various input parameters, including demographic information, health conditions, and lifestyle factors.\
\
## Dataset Information\
\
The dataset consists of the following attributes:\
\
1. **id:** Unique identifier for each patient.\
2. **gender:** Patient's gender ("Male", "Female", or "Other").\
3. **age:** Age of the patient.\
4. **hypertension:** 0 if the patient doesn't have hypertension, 1 if the patient has hypertension.\
5. **heart_disease:** 0 if the patient doesn't have any heart diseases, 1 if the patient has a heart disease.\
6. **ever_married:** "No" or "Yes".\
7. **work_type:** Patient's employment status ("children", "Govt_job", "Never_worked", "Private", or "Self-employed").\
8. **residence_type:** Patient's residence type ("Rural" or "Urban").\
9. **avg_glucose_level:** Average glucose level in the blood.\
10. **bmi:** Body mass index.\
11. **smoking_status:** Smoking status ("formerly smoked", "never smoked", "smokes", or "Unknown"). Note: "Unknown" means that the information is unavailable for this patient.\
12. **stroke:** Target variable - 1 if the patient had a stroke, 0 if not.\
\
## Objective\
\
The primary objective of utilizing this dataset is to predict whether a patient is likely to have a stroke based on the provided input parameters. The dataset provides a valuable resource for exploring the relationships between various factors and the occurrence of strokes.\
\
## Usage\
\
This dataset can be used for the following purposes:\
\
- Developing machine learning models for stroke prediction.\
- Exploratory data analysis to understand patterns and correlations.\
- Educational purposes to teach data analysis and predictive modeling.\
